# Nullary: An Esolang 

## Weclome to base 0

Nullary is a computer language that takes no user input. A correct implementation of Nullary takes no program and no parameters from the user. 

## Implementation Description 

Upon launch, Nullary takes note of the elapsed time since the epoch in microseconds (denoted T). 

Convert T into base 1 (unary). Execute this as input to the Unary or Progressive Unary esolangs.

If Nullary doesn't output something exciting in a quick enough time, you can turn off your computer.

## Language Variant: Nullary+

Instead of using Unary, translate T into base 8 and use it as Brainfuck input. This variant has the advantage of not having the input parsing delay that Unary/Progressive Unary has. 

## Comments

Note that Nullary is not Turing Complete.
